# 100 Days of AI Challenge

This repository documents my journey of learning AI/ML through structured daily practice over 100 days. The goal is to develop foundational and practical skills required to build AI systems and eventually become job-ready.


## Daily Structure
Each day includes:
- Topic / concept learned
- Notes and summaries
- Code or experiments
- Reflection and insights

## Learning Roadmap

1. Mathematics for ML (3Blue1Brown)
2. Python fundamentals and libraries  
   - NumPy  
   - Pandas  
   - Matplotlib  
3. Machine Learning fundamentals  
   - supervised / unsupervised  
4. Deep Learning using TensorFlow
5. Generative AI
6. Vector Databases
7. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
8. LangChain
9. AI Agents


## Why I am doing this
To build discipline, learn in public, gain practical AI skills, and create a track record of consistent execution.
